# Cepstral-k-means
Code accompanying the paper "Cepstral k-means"
## Summary
The code in this repository recreates the numerical examples in the manuscript "Cepstral k-means", a preprint of which can be found on [arXiv](placeholder), by Oliver Lauwers and Bart De Moor, which develops a novel time series clustering algorithm, providing a rigorous framework for clustering time series according to their underlying dynamics. It combines the well-known k-means algorithm with the weighted cepstral distance.
This manuscript has been sent in to be considered for publication to the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

Two main applications are available:
 - An example using Cylinder-Bell-Funnel data, in a .py-file. (CylinderBellFunnelExample.py)
 - A Jupyter notebook on unsupervised wind turbine generator anomaly detection. (Wind Turbine.ipynb)

Bear in mind that this code is not meant as a fully working software package, but serves merely as an illustration accompanying the manuscript mentioned earlier.
